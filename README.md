# ESP32_python_fuzzy
program for the implementation of a Fuzzy inference system using micropython and ESP32
the main-core file is for testing in your computer, feel free to play around with the paramenters of it, just in order to see everything you'll need matplolib, so a little detail i didnt contemplate.
the main-pots is the file that you might want to use in your ESP32, any esp32 will work, in my case i used a hornbill esp32.
cheers
